# UAceIt-Project-Report

##### This is regarding my UAceIt mentorship 2021 project, where I worked on the project "MALARIA DETECTION"

#### Contributor: Harshita Verma
#### Mentor: Harshbardhan Mishra

## Github Repository :
https://github.com/UAceIt-Winter-of-Mentorship/Malaria-Detection

## About the project : 
This Machine Learning Web Application utilizes a Two-Layered Convolutional Neural Network to process the Cell Images and predict if they are Malarial with an accuracy of nearly 95%. The Dataset to process the Deep Learning Algorithm is taken from the official US National Library of Medicine's NIH Website which is a repository of segmented cells from the thin blood smear slide images from the Malaria Screener research activity.

## Purpose of the Project
Where malaria is not endemic any more (such as in the United States), health-care providers may not be familiar with the disease. Clinicians seeing a malaria patient may forget to consider malaria among the potential diagnoses and not order the needed diagnostic tests. Laboratorians may lack experience with malaria and fail to detect parasites when examining blood smears under the microscope. Malaria is an acute febrile illness.

In a non-immune individual, symptoms usually appear 10–15 days after the infective mosquito bite. The first symptoms – fever, headache, and chills – may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. If not treated within 24 hours, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness, often leading to death.

Our Model performs fairly well with an accuracy of 95% and an F1 Score of 95% and Recall Score of 92%. This provides a handy tool to utilize the power of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Binary Classification Problems where time and accuracy is the paramount objective of classification.

## Technology Used :
Flask
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Tensorflow
Keras

## Further enhancement:
- Deploying the Web Application on Cloud.
- Development of an architecture using
- Pre-Trained Model like VGG16.
- Implementing the Model in PyTorch.
- Enhance the User-Interface using HTML/CSS.
- Set the Application on Docker.

## My experience:
This was the first time I participated in any mentorship program. Even though I had some previous experiences working with open source communities, I could never imagined getting this much exposure.
The support and responsiveness of my mentor made it easy for me to achieve milestones within the timeline. Meeting them every week and discussing my progress and problems helped me a lot to get things moving. Always providing quick reviews to my doubts, he made it really easy for me to solve issues which occurred during implementation. I cannot thank him enough for always guiding me and helping me emerge as a better programmer.
Finally, I would like to thank the Inclusive Design Institute for giving me this wonderful opportunity . Without my mentors, I wouldn’t have been able to work on this project as well as give my exams. I hope that I was able to give something back to the community. I’m planning to contribute to the community in near future and provide help in whatever way possible.
